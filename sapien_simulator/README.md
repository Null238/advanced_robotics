### Navigation
To navigate around the scene, you can use **WASD** keys on the keyboard to
move forward, left, backward, and right, just like in first person games.
Also like in games, you can turn the camera by holding right mouse button
and move the mouse.

### Camera options
In camera section, you can switch to an orthographic camera view, change the FOV
or movement speed (for WASD control). The other information is probably not
useful.

### Tips
Press "x" and "z" on the keyboard to visualize goal pose of all objects.
